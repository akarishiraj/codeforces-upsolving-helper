          This is because I have saved Problemset locally and update it after every contest but the user's submissions are fetched live from API.  
        </p>
        <p>
          So, many times, the Problem object (of a recent problem) coming live from API (User's submission) does not match with the Problem object of the <b>same</b> problem saved locally as some fields (like, Rating, Tags, etc) might have been added to the Problem object after the locally saved Problemset was updated.
        </p>

          I request you to please bear with this for the time being. But if this bothers you too much, do inform me, I will do something about it.
