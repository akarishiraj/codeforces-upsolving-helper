# codeforces-upsolving-helper
A python script that compiles all the Problems that you have attempted (at least once) on Codeforces but remained unsolved.
The problems are saved in a text file named *unsolved.txt*. Moreover, the problems are segregated by level (i.e. _A_, _B_, and so on).

## How to use 
* Install Python 3 (_Google_ if you need help).
* Install *requests* library by running this command in terminal ```pip install requests```.
* _Clone_ this repository or simply _copy_ the code of *script.py* file to another python file(say *local.py*) on your local system.
* Open terminal and run ```python3 local.py```.
* Just look for *unsolved.txt* file in the same folder where you created *local.py* file. Desried data is copied in *unsolved.txt* file.

## Note
* Feel free to raise any issue if there is some bug.
* Star the repository if it helped you in any way.
